    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once in a while there come to me out of the long ago the fragments of a
      story I have not thought of for years&mdash;one that has been hidden in
      the dim lumber-room of my brain where I store my by-gone memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      These fragments thrust themselves out of the past as do the cuffs of an
      old-fashioned coat, the flutings of a flounce, or the lacings of a bodice
      from out a quickly opened bureau drawer. Only when you follow the cuff
      along the sleeve to the broad shoulder; smooth out the crushed frill that
      swayed about her form, and trace the silken thread to the waist it
      tightened, can you determine the fashion of the day in which they were
      worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with the rummaging of this lumber-room come the odors: dry smells from
      musty old trunks packed with bundles of faded letters and worthless deeds
      tied with red tape; musty smells from dust-covered chests, iron bound,
      holding mouldy books, their backs loose; pungent smells from cracked
      wardrobes stuffed with moth-eaten hunting-coats, riding-trousers, and high
      boots with rusty spurs&mdash;cross-country riders these&mdash;roisterers
      and gamesters&mdash;a sorry lot, no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or perhaps it is an old bow-legged high-boy&mdash;its club-feet slippered
      on easy rollers&mdash;the kind with deep drawers kept awake by rattling
      brass handles, its outside veneer so highly polished that you are quite
      sure it must have been brought up in some distinguished family. The scent
      of old lavender and spiced rose leaves, and a stick or two of white orris
      root, haunt this relic: my lady&rsquo;s laces must be kept fresh, and so must my
      lady&rsquo;s long white mitts&mdash;they reach from her dainty knuckles quite to
      her elbow. And so must her cobwebbed silk stockings and the filmy kerchief
      she folds across her bosom:
    </p>
    <p>
      It is this kind of a drawer that I am opening now&mdash;one belonging to
      the Little Gray Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I look through its contents my eyes resting on the finger of a glove,
      the end of a lace scarf, and the handle of an old fan, my mind goes back
      to the last time she wore them. Then I begin turning everything upside
      down, lifting the corner of this incident, prying under that no bit of
      talk, recalling what he said and who told of it (I shall have the whole
      drawer empty before I get through), and whose fault it was that the match
      was broken off, and why she, of all women in the world, should have
      remained single all those years. Why, too, she should have lost her
      identity, so to speak, and become the Little Gray Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet no sobriquet could better express her personality: She was little&mdash;a
      dainty, elf-like littleness, with tiny feet and wee hands; she was gray&mdash;a
      soft, silver gray&mdash;too gray for her forty years (and this fragment
      begins when she was forty); and she was a lady in every beat of her warm
      heart; in every pressure of her white hand; in her voice, speech&mdash;in
      all her thoughts and movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lived in the quaintest of old houses fronted by a brick path bordered
      with fragrant box, which led up to an old-fashioned porch, its door
      brightened by a brass knocker. This, together with the knobs, steps, and
      slits of windows on each side of the door, was kept scrupulously clean by
      old Margaret, who had lived with her for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is her personality and not her surroundings that lingers in my
      memory. No one ever heard anything sweeter than her voice; in and nobody
      ever looked into a lovelier face, even if there were little hollows in the
      cheeks and shy, fanlike wrinkles lurking about the corners of her lambent
      brown eyes. Nor did her gray hair mar her beauty. It was not old, dry, and
      withered&mdash;a wispy gray. (That is not the way it happened.) It was a
      new, all-of-a-sudden gray, and in less than a week&mdash;so Margaret once
      told me&mdash;bleaching its brown gold to silver. But the gloss remained,
      and so did the richness of the folds, and the wealth and weight of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the green-painted door, with its white trim and brass knocker and
      knobs, there was a narrow hall hung with old portraits, opening into a
      room literally all fireplace. Here there were gouty sofas, and five or six
      big easy-chairs ranged in a half-circle, with arms held out as if begging
      somebody to sit in them; and here, too, was an embroidered worsted fire
      screen that slid up and down a standard, to shield one&rsquo;s face from the
      blazing logs; and there were queer tables and old-gold curtains looped
      back with brass rosettes&mdash;ears really&mdash;behind which the tresses
      of the parted curtains were tucked; and there were more old portraits in
      dingy frames, and samplers under glass, and a rug which some aunt had made
      with her own hands from odds and ends; and a huge work-basket spilling
      worsteds, and last, and by no manner of means least, a big chintz-covered
      rocking-chair, the little lady&rsquo;s very own&mdash;its thin ankles and splay
      feet hidden by a modest frill. There were all these things and a lot more&mdash;and
      yet I still maintain that the room was just one big fireplace. Not alone
      because of its size (and it certainly was big: many a doubting curly head,
      losing its faith in Santa Claus, has crawled behind the old fire-dogs, the
      child&rsquo;s fingers tight about the Little Gray Lady&rsquo;s, and been told to look
      up into the blue&mdash;a lesson never forgotten all their lives), but
      because of the wonderful and never-to-be-told-of things which constantly
      took place before its blazing embers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this fireplace was the Little Gray Lady&rsquo;s altar. Here she dispensed
      wisdom and cheer and love. Everybody in Pomford village had sat in one or
      the other of the chairs grouped about it and had poured out their hearts
      to her. All sorts of pourings: love affairs, for instance, that were
      hopeless until she would take the girl&rsquo;s hand in her own and smooth out
      the tangle; to-say nothing of bickerings behind closed doors, with two
      lives pulling apart until her dear arms brought them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all this is only the outside of the old mahogany high-boy with its
      meerschaum-pipe polish, spraddling legs, and rattling handles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for the Little Gray Lady&rsquo;s own particular drawer.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was Christmas Eve, and Kate Dayton, one of Pomford&rsquo;s pretty girls, had
      found the Little Gray Lady sitting alone before the fire gazing into the
      ashes, her small frame almost hidden in the roomy chair. The winter
      twilight had long since settled and only the flickering blaze of the logs
      and the dim glow from one lone candle illumined the room. This, strange to
      say, was placed on a table in a corner where its rays shed but little
      light in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Cousin Annie,&rdquo; moaned Kate (everybody in Pomford who got close enough
      to touch the Little Gray Lady&rsquo;s hand called her &ldquo;Cousin Annie&rdquo;&mdash;it
      was only the outside world who knew her by her other sobriquet), &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
      mean anything. Mark came in just at the wrong minute, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
       The poor girl&rsquo;s tears smothered the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him go, dearie,&rdquo; came the answer, when she had heard the whole
      story, the girl on her knees, her head in her lap, the wee hand stroking
      the fluff of golden hair dishevelled in her grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but he won&rsquo;t stay!&rdquo; moaned Kate. &ldquo;He says he is going to Rio&mdash;way
      out to South America to join his Uncle Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t go, dearie&mdash;not if you tell him the truth and make him tell
      you the truth. Don&rsquo;t let your pride come in; don&rsquo;t beat around the bush or
      make believe you are hurt or misunderstood, or that you don&rsquo;t care. You do
      care. Better be a little humble now than humble all your life. It only
      takes a word. Hold out your hand and say: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mark&mdash;please
      forgive me.&rsquo; If he loves you&mdash;and he does&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl raised her head: &ldquo;Oh! Cousin Annie! How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed gently. &ldquo;Because he was here, dearie, half an hour ago and
      told me so. He thought you owed him the dance, and he was a little jealous
      of Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Tom had asked me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and so had Mark&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but he had no right&mdash;&rdquo; She was up in arms again: she
      wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;she couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;and again an outburst of tears choked
      her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Little Gray Lady had known Kate&rsquo;s mother, now dead, and what might
      have happened but for a timely word&mdash;and she knew to her own sorrow
      what had happened for want of one. Kate and Mark should not repeat that
      experience if she could help it. She had saved the mother in the old days
      by just such a word. She would save the daughter in the same way. And the
      two were much alike&mdash;same slight, girlish figure; same blond hair and
      blue eyes; same expression, and the same impetuous, high-strung
      temperament. &ldquo;If that child&rsquo;s own mother walked in this minute I couldn&rsquo;t
      tell &lsquo;em apart, they do favor one another so,&rdquo; old Margaret had told her
      mistress when she opened the door for the girl, and she was right. Pomford
      village was full of these hereditary likenesses. Mark Dab-ney, whom all
      the present trouble was about, was so like his father at his age that his
      Uncle Harry had picked Mark out on a crowded dock when the lad had visited
      him in Rio the year before, although he had not seen the boy&rsquo;s father for
      twenty years&mdash;so strong was the family likeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there was to be a quarrel it must not be between the Dabneys and the
      Daytons, of all families. There had been suffering enough in the old days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, dearie,&rdquo; she said in her gentle, crooning tone, patting the
      girl&rsquo;s cheek as she talked. &ldquo;A quarrel where there is no love is soon
      forgotten, but a difference when both love may, if not quickly healed,
      leave a scar that will last through life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are as good fish in the sea as were ever caught,&rdquo; cried the girl in
      sheer bravado, brushing away her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe it, dearie&mdash;and don&rsquo;t ever say it. That has wrecked
      more lives than you know. That is what I once knew a girl to say&mdash;a
      girl just about your age&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she found somebody else, and that&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;m going to do. I&rsquo;m
      not going to have Mark read me a lecture every time I want to do something
      he doesn&rsquo;t like. Didn&rsquo;t your girl find somebody else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;never. She is still unmarried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but it wasn&rsquo;t her fault, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;although she did not know it at the time. She opened a door
      suddenly and found her lover alone with another girl. The two had stolen
      off together where they would not be interrupted. He was pleading for his
      college friend&mdash;straightening out just some such foolish quarrel as
      you have had with Mark&mdash;but the girl would not understand; nor did
      she know the truth until a year afterward. Then it was too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Little Gray Lady stopped, lifted her hand from the girl&rsquo;s head, and
      turned her face toward the now dying fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what became of him?&rdquo; asked the girl in a hushed voice, as if she
      dared not awaken the memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went away and she has never seen him since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes there was silence, then Kate said in a braver tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he married somebody else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, she died?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Littie Lady had not moved, nor had she taken her eyes from the blaze.
      She seemed to be addressing some invisible body who could hear and
      understand. The girl felt its influence and a tremor ran through her. The
      fitful blaze casting weird shadows helped this feeling. At last, with an
      effort, she asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you know them both, Cousin Annie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;he was my dear friend. I was just thinking of him when you came
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The charred logs broke into a heap of coals; the blaze flickered and died.
      But for the lone candle in the corner the room would have been in total
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I light another candle, Cousin Annie?&rdquo; shivered the girl, &ldquo;or bring
      that one nearer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s Christmas Eve, and I only light one candle on Christmas Eve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s one candle! Why, father has the whole house as bright as day
      and every fire blazing.&rdquo; The girl sprang to her feet and stepped nearer
      the hearth. She would be less nervous, she thought, if she moved about,
      and then the warmth of the fire was somehow reassuring. &ldquo;Please let me
      light them all, Cousin Annie,&rdquo; she pleaded, reaching out her hand toward a
      cluster in an old-fashioned candelabra&mdash;&ldquo;and if there aren&rsquo;t enough
      I&rsquo;ll get more from Margaret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;one will do. It is an old custom of mine; I&rsquo;ve done it for
      twenty years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you love Christmas?&rdquo; Kate argued, her nervousness increasing.
      The ghostly light and the note of pain in her companion&rsquo;s voice were
      strangely affecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Little Gray Lady leaned forward in her chair and looked long and
      steadily at the heap of smouldering ashes; then she answered slowly, each
      word vibrating with the memory of some hidden sorrow: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had mine,
      dearie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can have some more,&rdquo; urged Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not like those that have gone before, dearie&mdash;no, not like those.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something in the tones of her voice and quick droop of the dear head
      stirred the girl to her depths. Sinking to her knees she hid her face in
      the Little Lady&rsquo;s lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you sit here in the dark with only one candle?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, always,&rdquo; she answered, her fingers stroking the fair hair. &ldquo;I can
      see those I have loved better in the dark. Sometimes the room is full of
      people; I have often to strain my eyes to assure myself that the door is
      really shut. All sorts of people come&mdash;the girls and boys I knew when
      I was young. Some are dead; some are far away; some so near that should I
      open the window and shout their names many of them could hear. There are
      fewer above ground every year&mdash;but I welcome all who come. It&rsquo;s the
      old maid&rsquo;s hour, you know&mdash;this twilight hour. The wives are making
      ready the supper; the children are romping; lovers are together in the
      corner where they can whisper and not be overheard. But none of this
      disturbs me&mdash;no big man bursts in, letting in the cold. I have my
      chair, my candle, my thoughts, and my fire. When you get to be my age,
      Kate, and live alone&mdash;and you might, dearie, if Mark should leave you&mdash;you
      will love these twilight hours, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl reached up her hands and touched the Little Gray Lady&rsquo;s cheek,
      whispering:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t you very, <i>very</i> lonely. Cousin Annie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Kate remained silent, then she asked in a faltering voice
      through which ran a note almost of terror:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I shall ever be like&mdash;like&mdash;that is&mdash;I shall
      ever be&mdash;all alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, dearie. No one can ever tell what will happen. I never
      thought twenty years ago I should be all alone&mdash;but I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl raised her head, and with a cry of pain threw her arms around the
      Little Gray Lady&rsquo;s neck:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&mdash;no! I can&rsquo;t bear it!&rdquo; she sobbed! &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Mark! I&rsquo;ll
      send for him&mdash;to-night-before I go to bed!&rdquo;

    <p>
      It was not until Kate Dayton reached her father&rsquo;s gate that the spell
      wrought by the flickering firelight and the dim glow of the ghostly candle
      wore off. The crisp air of the winter night&mdash;for it was now quite
      dark&mdash;had helped, but the sight of Mark&rsquo;s waiting figure striding
      along the snow-covered path to her home and his manly outspoken apology,
      &ldquo;Please forgive me, Kate, I made an awful fool of myself,&rdquo; followed by her
      joyous refrain, &ldquo;Oh, Mark! I&rsquo;ve been so wretched!&rdquo; had done more. It had
      all come just as Cousin Annie had said; there had been neither pride nor
      anger. Only the Little Gray Lady&rsquo;s timely word.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the spell was broken the pathetic figure of the dear woman, her
      eyes fixed on the dying embers, still lingered in Kate&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mark, it is so pitiful to see her!&mdash;and I got so frightened; the
      whole room seemed filled with ghosts. Christmas seems her loneliest time.
      She won&rsquo;t have but one candle lighted, and she sits and mopes in the dark.
      Oh, it&rsquo;s dreadful! I tried to cheer her up, but she says she likes to sit
      in the dark, because then all the dead people she loves can come to her.
      Can&rsquo;t we do something to make her happy? She is so lovely, and she is so
      little, and she is so dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had entered the house, now a blaze of light. Kate&rsquo;s father was
      standing on the hearth rug, his back to a great fireplace filled with
      roaring logs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you two gadabouts been?&rdquo; he laughed merrily. &ldquo;What do you mean
      by staying out this late? Don&rsquo;t you know it&rsquo;s Christmas Eve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been to see Cousin Annie, daddy; and it would make your heart ache
      to look at her! She&rsquo;s there all alone. Can&rsquo;t you go down and bring her up
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I could, but she wouldn&rsquo;t come, not on Christmas Eve. Did she have
      her candle burning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, just one poor little miserable candle that hardly gave any light at
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it was in the corner on a little table?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, all by itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor dear, she always lights it. She&rsquo;s lighted it for almost twenty
      years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it for somebody she loved who died?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;it&rsquo;s for somebody she loved who is alive, but who never came
      back and won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He studied them both for a moment, as if in doubt, then he added in a
      determined voice, motioning them to a seat beside him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is about time you two children heard the story straight, for it
      concerns you both, so I&rsquo;ll tell you. Your Uncle Harry, Mark, is the man
      who never came back and won&rsquo;t. He was just your age at the time. He and
      Annie were to be married in a few months, then everything went to smash.
      And it was your mother, Kate, who was the innocent cause of his exile.
      Harry, who was the best friend I had in the world, tried to put in a good
      word for me&mdash;this was before I and your mother were engaged&mdash;and
      Annie, coming in and finding them, got it all crooked. Instead of waiting
      until Harry could explain, she flared up, and off he went. Her hair turned
      white in a week when she found out how she had misjudged him, but it was
      too late then&mdash;Harry wouldn&rsquo;t come back, and he never will. When he
      told you, Mark, last year in Rio that he was coming home Christmas I knew
      he&rsquo;d change his mind just as soon as you left him, and he did. Queer boy,
      Harry. Once he gets an idea in his head it sticks there. He was that way
      when he was a boy. He&rsquo;ll never come back as long as Annie lives, and that
      means never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped a moment, spread his fingers to the blazing logs, and then,
      with a smile on his face, said: &ldquo;If ever I catch you two young turtledoves
      making such fools of yourselves, I&rsquo;ll turn you both outdoors,&rdquo; and again
      his hearty laugh rang through the cheery room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl instinctively leaned closer to her lover. She had heard some part
      of the story before&mdash;in fact, both of them had, but never in its
      entirety. Her heart went out to the Little Gray Lady all the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark now spoke up. He, too, had had an hour of his own with the Little
      Gray Lady, and the obligation still remained unsettled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if she won&rsquo;t come up here and have Christmas with us,&rdquo; he cried,
      &ldquo;why can&rsquo;t we go down there and have Christmas with her? Let&rsquo;s surprise
      her, Kate; let&rsquo;s clean out all those dead people. I know she sits in the
      dark and imagines they all come back, for I&rsquo;ve seen her that way many a
      time when I drop in on her in the late afternoon. Let&rsquo;s show her they&rsquo;re
      alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate started up and caught Mark&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Oh, Mark! I have it!&rdquo; she
      whispered, &ldquo;and we will&mdash;yes&mdash;that will be the very thing,&rdquo; and
      so with more mumblings and mutterings, not one word of which could her
      father hear, the two raced up-stairs to the top of the house and the
      garret.

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two hours later a group of young people led by Mark Dabney trooped out of
      Kate&rsquo;s gate and turned down the Little Gray Lady&rsquo;s street. Most of them
      wore long cloaks and were muffled in thick veils.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were talking in low tones, glancing from side to side, as if fearing
      to be seen. The moon had gone under a cloud, but the light of the stars,
      aided by an isolated street lamp, showed them the way. So careful were
      they to conceal their identity that the whole party&mdash;there were six
      in all&mdash;would dart into an open gate, crouching behind the snow-laden
      hedge to avoid even a single passer-by. Only once were they in any danger,
      and that was when a sleigh gliding by stopped in front of them, the driver
      calling out in a voice which sounded twice as loud in the white stillness:
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mr. Dabney&rsquo;s new house?&rdquo; (evidently a stranger, for the town pump
      was not better known). No one else stopped them until they reached the
      Little Gray Lady&rsquo;s porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate crept up first, followed by Mark, and peered in. So far as she could
      see everything was just as she had left it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The candle is still burning, Mark, and she&rsquo;s put more wood on the fire.
      But I can&rsquo;t find her. Oh, yes&mdash;there she is&mdash;in her big chair&mdash;you
      can just see the top of her head and her hand. Hush! don&rsquo;t one of you
      breathe. Now, listen, girls! Mark and I will tiptoe in first&mdash;the
      front door is never fastened&mdash;and if she is asleep&mdash;and I think
      she is&mdash;we will all crouch down behind her until she wakes up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And another thing,&rdquo; whispered Mark from behind his hand&mdash;&ldquo;everybody
      must drop their coats and things in the hall, so we can surprise her all
      at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The strange procession tiptoed in and arranged itself behind the Little
      Gray Lady&rsquo;s chair. Kate was dressed in her mother&rsquo;s wedding-gown, flaring
      poke bonnet, and long, faded gloves clear to her shoulder; Mark had on a
      blue coat with brass buttons, a buff waistcoat, and black stock, the two
      points of the high collar pinching his ruddy cheeks&mdash;the same dress
      his father and Uncle Harry had worn, and all the young bloods of their
      day, for that matter. The others were in their grandmother&rsquo;s or
      grandfather&rsquo;s short and long clothes, Tom Fields sporting a tight-sleeved,
      high-collared coat, silk-embroidered waistcoat, and pumps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate crept up behind her chair, but Mark moved to the fireplace and rested
      his elbow on the mantel, so that he would be in full view when the Little
      Gray Lady awoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last her eyes opened, but she made no outcry, nor did she move, except
      to lift her head as does a fawn startled by some sudden light, her
      wondering eyes drinking in the apparition. Mark, hardly breathing, stood
      like a statue, but Kate, bending closer, heard her catch her breath with a
      long, indrawn sigh, and next the half-audible words: &ldquo;No&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t so&mdash;How
      foolish I am&mdash;&rdquo; Then there came softly: &ldquo;Harry&rdquo;&mdash;and again in
      almost a whisper&mdash;as if hope had died in her heart&mdash;&ldquo;Harry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate, half frightened, sprang forward and flung her arms around the Little
      Gray Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you know him? It&rsquo;s Mark, Cousin Annie, and here&rsquo;s Tom and
      Nanny Fields, and everybody, and we&rsquo;re going to light all the candles&mdash;every
      one of them, and make an awful big fire&mdash;and have a real, real
      Christmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Little Gray Lady was awake now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you scared me so!&rdquo; she cried, rising to her feet, rubbing her eyes.
      &ldquo;You foolish Children! I must have been asleep&mdash;yes, I know I was!&rdquo;
       She greeted them all, talking and entering into their fun, the spirit of
      hospitality now hers, saying over and over again how glad she was they
      came, kissing one and another; telling them how happy they made her; how
      since they had been kind enough to come, she would let them have a <i>real</i>
      Christmas&mdash;&ldquo;Only,&rdquo; she added quickly, &ldquo;it will have to be by the
      light of one candle; but that won&rsquo;t make any difference, because you can
      pile on just as much wood as you choose. Yes,&rdquo; she continued, her voice
      rising in her effort to meet them on their own joyous plane&mdash;&ldquo;pile on
      all the kindling, too, Mark; and Kate, dear, please run and tell Margaret
      to bring in every bit of cake she has in the pantry. Oh, how like your
      mother you are, Kate! I remember that very dress. And you, Mark! Why,
      you&rsquo;ve got on the same coat I saw your father wear at the Governor&rsquo;s ball.
      And you, too, Tom. Oh, what a good time we will all have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon the lid of the old piano was raised, a spinet, really, and one of the
      girls began running her fingers over the keys; and later on it was agreed
      that the first dance was to be the Virginia reel, with all the hospitable
      chairs and the fire screen and the gouty old sofa rolled back against the
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      This all arranged, Mark took his place with the Little Gray Lady for a
      partner. The music struck up a lively tune and as quickly ceased as the
      sound of bells rang through the night air. In the hush that followed a
      sleigh was heard at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate sprang up and clapped her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they are just in time! There come the rest of them, Cousin Annie. Now
      we are going to have a great party! Let&rsquo;s be dancing when they come in;
      keep on playing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this instant the door opened and Margaret put in her head. &ldquo;Somebody,&rdquo;
       she said, with a low bow, &ldquo;wants to see Mr. Mark on business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mark, looking like a gallant of the old school, excused himself with a
      great flourish to the Little Gray Lady and strode out. In the hall, with
      his back to the light, stood a broad-shouldered man muffled to the chin in
      a fur overcoat. The boy was about to apologize for his costume and then
      ask the man&rsquo;s errand, when the stranger turned quickly and gripped his
      wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush&mdash;not a word! Where is she?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a low whistle of surprise Mark pushed open the door. The stranger
      stepped in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Little Gray Lady raised her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who can this new guest be?&rdquo; she asked&mdash;&ldquo;and in what a queer
      costume, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man drew himself up to his full height and threw wide his coat: &ldquo;And
      you don&rsquo;t know me, Annie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not take her eyes from his face, nor did she move except to turn
      her head appealingly to the room as if she feared they were playing her
      another trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had reached her side and stood looking down at her. Again came the
      voice&mdash;a strong, clear voice, with a note of infinite tenderness
      through it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How white your hair is, Annie; and your hand is so thin! Have I changed
      like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned forward, scanning him eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little cry, then all her soul went out in the one word:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was inside the big coat now, his strong arms around her, her head
      hidden on his breast, only the tips of her toes on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had kissed her again and again&mdash;and he did and before
      everybody&mdash;he crossed the room, picked up the ghostly candle, and
      smothered its flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw it from the road,&rdquo; he laughed softly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s why I couldn&rsquo;t wait.
      But you&rsquo;ll never have to light it again, my darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw them both a few years later. Everything in the way of fading and
      wrinkling had stopped so far as the Little Gray Lady was concerned. If
      there were any lines left in her forehead and around the corners of her
      eyes, I could not find them. Joy had planted a crop of dimples instead,
      and they had spread out, smoothing the care lines. Margaret even claimed
      that her hair was turning brown gold once more, but then Margaret was
      always her loyal slave, and believed everything her mistress wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, if you don&rsquo;t mind, dear reader, we will put everything back and
      shut the Little Gray Lady&rsquo;s bureau drawer.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
